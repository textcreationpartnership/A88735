         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:153247:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>This Morning he was put into a Sledge at <hi>Newgate</hi> between ten and eleven, &amp; from thence being drawn to the place of Execution vvhere taken out of the Sledge and put into a Cart which was drawn un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Gallows, then turning himſelf round, directed his Speech to the People.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Gentlemen I being brought hither to ſuffer according to Law, for Clipping, Cutting, &amp; Defacing the Current Coin of this Nation; I take God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to witneſs</hi> I <hi>am not Guilty of the Fact, for which I am now about to dye, neither am I Guilty of what I was Indicted.</hi>
               </q>
               <p>Mr. Ordinary being in the Cart to aſſiſt him in Prayer, and alſo another Divine a Friend of his; Mr. Ordinary asked him how far he was Guilty, and what he would own of the Crime for which he was novv to ſuffer, and whether he had no time of his Life aforepaſt, if not now as mentioned in his Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had been Guilty of that Fact, or what he could ſay as to that Point, to which he anſwered that the thing was thus;</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>That there were three Perſons of his Acquaintance, which were in Priſon for a Fact of this Nature, and were ſet at liberty, to diſcover ſome other Perſons of the ſame Gang upon which he was taken up, which three Perſons, were</hi> Nicholſon, Martin, <hi>and</hi> Hickup, <hi>that</hi> Nicholſon <hi>being poor in Town, and deſtitute of Friends, he had with all kindneſs aſſiſted him; and afterwards recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to a Gentleman of Quality to wait upon him, and became Engaged at the ſame time for his Truth and Honeſty, that afterwards he being out of this Place, he put him into Imployment in his own Bſineſs, and had truſted him with the Receipt of ſome hundred pounds, that he had at ſeveral times re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Clipp'd Money from him and had ſold ſeveral Ounces of melted Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, but did never Clip any Silver himſelf or ſee any body elſe do it, that they were the perſons really guilty, and had accuſed him to ſave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves That particularly</hi> Nicholſon <hi>had received two hundred pound at</hi> Darby, <hi>which he returned to him in Clipt Money:</hi>
               </q>
               <p>Upon which Mr. Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary told him, <hi>Mr. Jackſon,</hi> you could not recieve all this clipp'd mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and put it off, but you muſt know from whence you had it, and confederate with thoſe that clipp'd it, to which he only anſwer'd; <hi>You your ſelf Sir, without doubt, and others too, have put off clipp'd money with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being always inquiſitive from whence you recieved it.</hi>

               <p>His whole Behaviour was modeſt and humble, and certainly never any Criminal at the hour of Death, gave greater Arguments of a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and contrite heart, of a true and ſincere Repentance than this Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactor did. He prayed loud, with all fervency of Spirit, firſt with Mr. Ordinary, and then deſired another Miniſter a Friend of his, to pray with him, which he did, with all the holy Violence of Devotion a poor penitent wretch could expreſs his abhorrence of his ſins, and beg mercy of Almighty God for his poor Soul, which was now ſo ſuddenly to appear before the great Judge of Heaven and Earth. His whole Conduct in the midſt of all the Terrors of Death, was highly commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Spectators who were very Numerous; he behav'd himſelf with Courage enough to ſhow he was not afraid to die, and with all the Expreſſions of Sorrow and Penitence a good Chriſtian could expire withal. The generality of perſons gave ſufficient Teſtimony how much they were affected with his Chriſtian Behaviour, and few per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons Preſent departed with dry Eyes. He deſired ſome Friends who were near him, to carry his Love and Bleſſing to his poor Wife and child, and beg'd of them to be aſſiſtant to them in this their ſorrowful <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
